This project is a web-based interactive simulation of the Solar System, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents the Sun and all eight planets with accurate relative positioning, orbital motion, and styling inspired by real astronomical data.

The simulation showcases planetary orbits, planet rotation, and their relative sizes and distances (scaled) in a visually engaging and educational way. Each celestial body moves in a circular orbit around the Sun, demonstrating basic principles of celestial mechanics and planetary motion.
